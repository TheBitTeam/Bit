Bit Core integration/staging tree
=====================================


What is Bit?
----------------

Bit is a digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bit Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency. Bit is based on the infrastructure of bitcoin, with parameters optimized for a modern deployment.
